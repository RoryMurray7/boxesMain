Analyze individual survey responses about a product in JSON format.

# Steps

1. **Parse the JSON File**: Read each survey response
2. **Identify Key Themes**: Examine the feedback for repetitive comments or common themes to determine the overall sentiment.
3. **Consensus Summary**: Summarize the general consensus in a paragraph.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Identify and list three clear, actionable insights derived from the feedback to improve the product. Ensure each insight is supported by the feedback data.

# Output Format
Provide the output as a JSON object with the following structure:
- general_sentiment: a string summarizing the overall sentiment.
- average_score: a number representing the average score of the feedback.
- total_responses: an integer indicating the total number of responses.
- actionable_insights: an array of 3-5 strings, each detailing a specific actionable insight.

# Notes

- Ensure the insights are directly actionable and relevant to product improvement.
- Maintain objectivity and avoid drawing unsupported conclusions based only on a couple of responses.
- Wrap text in * for bold, ** for italic and # for subtitles
- omit any information from the output that could identify a person such as their email or name
