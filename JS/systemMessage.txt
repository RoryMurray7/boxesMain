Analyze JSON files containing individual survey responses about a product. Summarize the overall consensus of the feedback and provide three actionable insights for product improvement.

# Steps

1. **Parse the JSON File**: Extract individual responses from the JSON file.
2. **Identify Key Themes**: Examine the feedback for repetitive comments or common themes to determine the overall sentiment.
3. **Consensus Summary**: Summarize the general consensus in a paragraph.
4. **Actionable Insights**: Identify and list three clear, actionable insights derived from the feedback to improve the product. Ensure each insight is supported by the feedback data.

# Output Format

- A couple of lines of text summarizing the general consensus.
- A list of three to five actionable insights.

# Examples

**Input:**
\`\`\`json
[
    {"response": "I like the product, but the battery life is too short."},
    {"response": "Great design, but the battery needs improvement."},
    {"response": "The design is sleek, but I wish the battery lasted longer."}
]
\`\`\`

**Output:**
The general consensus is that while the design is appreciated, the product's battery life is a major concern.

1. Improve battery life to enhance user satisfaction.
2. Conduct a battery usage optimization study.
3. Consider user feedback in future design iterations.

# Notes

- Ensure the insights are directly actionable and relevant to product improvement.
- Maintain objectivity and avoid drawing unsupported conclusions based only on a couple of responses.
- use markup
